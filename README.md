## Introduction
Cream (Contrastive Reading Model) is a language-image understanding module designed to enhance the visually-situated natural language understanding capability in Large Language Models (LLMs). The primary goal of Cream is to effectively capture intricate details in images (e.g., texts), ensuring accurate responses in various visual langauge precessing applications.
